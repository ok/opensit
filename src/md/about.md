# About OpenSIT

SAP Inside Tracks are regular mini conferences, locally organised by passioned SAP community members, where knowledge and experience is being shared in talks or sessions. To make their conference content more broadly accessible, some SAP Inside Tracks started live streaming and recording these sessions. 

The missions of OpenSIT is to make all sessions recorded at SAP Inside Tracks easily accessible to SAP community members.

All session recordings are currently hosted on YouTube, distributed across various channels, and often hard to find and discover. opensit.net makes all SAP Inside Track session recordings accessible from a single site. The content is organised by SAP Inside Tracks and their often annual conferences. Each SAP Inside Track page provides links to their Twitter hashtag, YouTube account and Twitter channel, if available. Each session page lists the session speakers and, if available, links to their SCN profiles or Twitter accounts.

The SAP community has a strong presence on Twitter. @opensitnet provides updates on new sessions or events available on opensit.net, and promotes random session content to its followers. We also use @opensitnet to post updates about changes and enhancements to the website.

SAP Inside Track organisers have a how-to document in SCN Wiki available, where the various setups and required equipments are being documented. OpenSIT of course supports the idea to make more sessions online accessible, that are done at the 40+ SAP Inside Tracks happening worldwide each year. Where possible, we help to share and improve the documentation of recording setups for all SAP Inside Track and their organisers.
